Serverless refers to a class of cloud services that require minimal or zero server management, configuration, patching, provisioning or scaling actions by the user.

The most common examples are in the compute space with "serverless functions" such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions or Google Cloud Run where you can write code and have it respond to events without any management of cloud resources.

Serverless doesn't just apply to short-lived compute though, it also applies to:

* Serverless container management and execution
* Databases (e.g. AWS DynamoDb, Azure CosmoDB)
* Storage (e.g. AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage)
* Other managed services such as AI, Search, Messaging, Queueing etc.
