### How does it work

[cloud-architecture.io](https://cloud-architecture.io) is written using as [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) on [github](https://github.com/macmike/cloud-architecture.io).

As content is pushed to github the [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) service picks up the changes, spins up a container to do the hugo build and deploys the site through the AWS content delivery network. This is all serverless and invisible, Amplify takes care of it all automatically providing a CI/CD pipeline for this site.
